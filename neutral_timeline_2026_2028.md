# The 2028 Intelligence Repricing

*A neutral scenario. Not a prediction.*

You're reading this in June 2028. Here's what actually happened.

## Q2 2026 — The Scare

The Citrini report went viral. Markets panicked. The S&P shed 11% in three weeks as every SaaS company, IT outsourcer, and staffing firm got re-rated to "AI-vulnerable." Accenture lost 40% of its market cap. Infosys and Wipro hit 5-year lows. CNBC ran the word "SaaSpocalypse" 312 times in February alone.

Layoff announcements accelerated — not because revenue collapsed, but because CFOs used the narrative as political cover to cut headcount they'd wanted to trim since 2023. Tech companies announced 180,000 job cuts in H1 2026. Most were backfilled by 4-person teams running AI agents.

## Q4 2026 — The Divergence

Two economies emerged.

**Economy A** — the legacy workforce — contracted. White-collar unemployment in financial services, legal, and IT consulting hit 7.8%. Office REITs in NYC and London marked down 15-25%. India's IT services exports declined for the first time in two decades. The rupee weakened to 94/USD.

**Economy B** — the AI-native layer — exploded. Stripe processed $680B in Q4 alone as 2.3 million new micro-businesses launched in the US. Shopify added more merchants in 2026 than in 2020-2023 combined. AWS, Azure, and GCP reported record compute revenue. NVIDIA shipped 3.2 million H200s.

GDP grew 2.1%. But the composition changed. Corporate profits hit records while median household income fell 3.2% in real terms. Ghost GDP was real — just not as catastrophic as Citrini feared.

## H1 2027 — The Messy Middle

The doom narrative faded. The boom narrative also faded. What replaced both was something uglier and more boring: structural adjustment.

Unemployment peaked at 6.4% — painful, not apocalyptic. The jobs that disappeared were $85K-$150K knowledge work roles. The jobs that appeared were either >$200K (AI architects, prompt engineers, system designers) or <$45K (care work, trades, logistics). The middle hollowed.

Congress passed the Emergency Workforce Transition Act — retraining credits, extended UI for displaced white-collar workers, tax incentives for companies hiring humans in customer-facing roles. It was underfunded. It helped at the margins.

India stabilized after an IMF credit line and a pivot to AI-assisted services at 60% lower price points. Not a recovery — a restructuring.

The S&P recovered to flat from its February 2026 panic lows. But sector rotation was violent. Tech infrastructure names (NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL) were up 35-50%. Everything that sold human time (ACN, INFY, WIT, RHI, MAN) was still down 20-40%.

## Q2 2028 — Where We Are Now

S&P 500: down 8% from the October 2026 high. Not the 38% crash Citrini modeled. Not the V-shaped recovery Kobeissi implied.

US unemployment: 5.9%, falling slowly. The new jobs don't look like the old jobs.

The real story isn't collapse or abundance. It's repricing. The market is repricing what human time is worth, sector by sector, role by role. Some of that repricing is brutal. Some of it is creating more wealth than any period since the internet.

Both Citrini and Kobeissi were right about the mechanism. Neither was right about the magnitude.

The world didn't end. It just got repriced.
